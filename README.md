# Themes for Teams - Chrome Extension

I work for a company that recently migrated to Teams.  

I decided to build a Chrome Extension to customize it to
suit my purposes.

## Features

- Reduction in unnecessary padding around elements
- Font Selection
- Themes Selection
- Moves Post Titles beside avatar - much nicer!
- Subtle style changes to give Teams an edge!

## Installation

1. Visit: chrome://extensions/
2. Enable Developer Mode (top right!)
3. Click 'Load Unpacked'
4. Select the folder you unzipped this to that contains manifest.json
5. Reclaim your wasted screen real estate!


## Changelog

v0.0.1
  - Widened Chats, Channels, Reduced Team/Channel List gutter and set default font to Lato
